Predicting Flu Vaccine Uptake Using Machine Learning
Project Description:
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood that individuals will receive the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The focus is on generating two separate probability predictions: one for the xyz vaccine and one for the seasonal flu vaccine. The challenge is set as a multilabel problem, where each target variable is binary, indicating whether or not the respondent received the respective vaccine.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 36 columns, with the first column, respondent_id, serving as a unique identifier. The remaining 35 features encompass a variety of demographic, behavioral, and opinion-related variables. Key features are:

Demographics: Information such as age group, sex, education level, race, income level, marital status, employment status, and geographic location.
Health Behaviors: Variables indicating behaviors like taking antiviral medications, purchasing face masks, washing hands frequently, avoiding large gatherings, and reducing contact with people outside the household.
Vaccine Opinions: Respondent's views on the effectiveness and risks associated with the xyz and seasonal vaccines, their level of concern about the xyz flu, and their knowledge about the xyz flu.
Doctor Recommendations: Whether a healthcare provider recommended the xyz or seasonal flu vaccine.
Household Information: Data on the number of adults and children in the household, and contact with children under six months.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Address missing values by forward filling.
Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions and relationships between features and target variables.
Conduct correlation analysis to identify key features impacting vaccine uptake.
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Utilize a machine learning model suitable for multilabel classification, such as a RandomForestClassifier wrapped in a MultiOutputClassifier.
Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to enhance model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using the ROC AUC score for both target variables.
Validate model robustness through cross-validation techniques.
Prediction and Submission:

Generate probabilistic predictions for both the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines.
Format the results as specified, preparing a submission file that includes respondent_id, xyz_vaccine probability, and seasonal_vaccine probability.
Expected Outcomes
The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that accurately estimates the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The performance metric, ROC AUC, will be used to evaluate the model, aiming for a high score that reflects strong predictive accuracy.

Insights from this project can aid public health officials in understanding the factors influencing vaccine uptake, thereby enabling targeted interventions to increase vaccination rates. This can ultimately lead to improved public health outcomes and a reduction in the spread of the flu. By effectively utilizing machine learning, the project aims to provide a valuable tool for enhancing vaccination campaigns and promoting better health practices.
